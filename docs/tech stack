We will be using two main tech stacks for our project:
1. React.js
  We chose to use React because it is a popular framework, with a lot of support and tutorials, which can help when we get stuck. It is powerful
  and setting it up is very smooth. The process for choosing this framework is that we thought of some frontend tech stacks we could use, but almost
  immediately agreed on React. 
  
2. Django 
  We chose Django because it is user friendly, and beginner friendly. It is also a framework that is using Python mainly, which makes it very
  intuitive as most of us have Python experience. We also decided to use this, because it has an in-built database we can hopefully take advantage of.
  We also wanted to try something new, as none of us had used Django before. This framework is also very popular, and there are tutorials for 
  using it with React, which makes our setting up, a lot better.

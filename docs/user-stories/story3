3. As a pokemon fan, I want to get a random pokemon generated by the site based on the local weather data, so that the boring process of checking weather will become more interesting.
  - This user story is the other main component of our web app, generating a random pokemon based on the weather data. And it is important because it stresses the uniqueness of our web app compared to other weather applications. We will need to get the pokemon for the type that we want, and display it with images saved on this repo: https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites. For example, our app will generate a pokemon with water element on a rainy day so that the pokemon is related to current weather.

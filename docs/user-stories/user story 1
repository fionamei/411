 I want to be able to login and sign up with Google authentication. This will be done using Firebase, so that the user's database gets initialized
 if it's their first time on the app. Otherwise, it just gets their information. Displays a welcome message for the user to see. 
 We also want to set up the frontend and backend with react, django, and firebase.

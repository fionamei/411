I want to be able to display the pokemon in my pokedex. This takes the pokemon from user's database, with the pokemon's unique id for the 
pokemon in a saved pokemonsArray, and displays all caught pokemons as a list on the page after a button is clicked to call a function to display 
the pokemon. The pokedex page will take in all the unique pokemon id's that the user's database has saved, and display them one by one. 
We will want to display the pictures of each pokemon along with their names and potentially their traits (ie. element) as well. 
To get the pictures of each pokemon displayed, we will use the  https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites repository of the pokemon api, to generate 
images for each pokemon.

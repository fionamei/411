 I want to be able to search for a pokemon, and find what conditions it will appear under. This allows the users to see how they can catch the
 specific pokemon they want. The database will have all the unique pokemon id's that the database contains. When the user searches the pokemons
 name in a search bar it will make a call to the database to retrieve the appropriate pokemon id that is related to the name that is inputed and
 it will display all the weather conditions in which that pokemon will be displayed in. To get the conditions that the pokemon will appear in, we
 can manually set conditions, like temperature and weather, for pokemon of different element types. We can also randomly generate this data in the
 beginning in order to generate conditions initially for the pokemon.

I want to be able to save the pokemon in my pokedex. This saves the pokemon to user's database, with the pokemon's unique id for the 
pokemon appended to user saved pokemonsArray in order for it to be dispalyed in the pokedex page. The pokedex page will take in all 
the unique pokemon id's that the user's database has saved. The array will only store the appropriate pokemon IDS for each specific user.
The appropriate user ID will be initialized in the database when the user logs in. This will ensure that when a pokemon is generated based on 
a given zipcode, that it will be added to the array in the database accordingly.

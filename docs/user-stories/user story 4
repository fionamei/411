I want to be able to save and display the pokemon in my pokedex. This saves the pokemon to user's database, with the pokemon's unique id for the 
pokemon appended to user saved pokemonsArray, and displays all caught pokemons in a separate "pokedex" page. The pokedex page will take in all 
the unique pokemon id's that the user's database has saved, and display them one by one. We will want to display the pictures of each pokemon along 
with their names and potentially their traits (ie. element) as well. To get the pictures of each pokemon displayed, we will use the 
https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites repository of the pokemon api, to generate images for each pokemon.

 I want to be able to check the current weather data for my location. This user story is the main component of our app, this views 
 the weather data and categorizes it for the condition that the random pokemon spawns from (ie. below 30 degrees spawns an ice type pokemon), 
 and allows users to be able to use this web app to check weather data. This might include having to get user's location, and then passing that
 into the weather api to generate weather data. After generating weather data, we will need to be able to write functions that determines which
 pokemon get spawned, and under which conditions they do.

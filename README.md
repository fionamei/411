## Idea 1 - Food Analysis
 - Web app that will find [recipes](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) of food and give you the [nutritional analysis](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition) of it. The idea of this project is to help users develop better eating habits, and become more aware of what they are ingesting.

## Idea 2 - Random Weather Pokemon
 - Web app that generates a random [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) based on their attributes that correspond to the [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). This project will be like a weather app, with an additional Pokemon feature, to bring it more fun, so users who love Pokemon can get Pokemons and weather data in one place. 
  
## Idea 3 - Pokemon Similarity 
 - Web app that allows you to upload a picture of your face, [scans it](https://skybiometry.com/documentation/), and gives you a [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) that most resembles you. This is a more silly web app, to potentially make people laugh and to entertain.

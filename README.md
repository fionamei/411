Team 5 of Lab A2 - **indicates the idea we have chosen

## Idea 1 - Food Analysis
 - Web app that will find [recipes](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) of food and give you the [nutritional analysis](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition) of it. The idea of this project is to help users develop better eating habits, and become more aware of what they are ingesting. Our database in this app will hold information for user login such as name, email, password, and their starred recipes. The limitations for this would be if results from the Recipes API cannot match to an acceptable input for Nutritritional Analysis API.

## **Idea 2 - Random Weather Pokemon
 - Web app that generates a random [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) based on their attributes that correspond to the [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). This project will be like a weather app, with an additional Pokemon feature, to bring it more fun, so users who love Pokemon can get Pokemons and weather data in one place. Our database in this app will hold information for user login such as name, email, password, and a "Pokedex" for all the Pokemons they have collected. 
  
## Idea 3 - Pokemon Similarity 
 - Web app that allows you to upload a picture of your face, [scans it](https://skybiometry.com/documentation/), and gives you a [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) that most resembles you. This is a more silly web app, to potentially make people laugh and to entertain. Our database in this app will hold information for user login such as name, email, password, alnog with the data from your previous scans. The limitations of this are determining how a corresponding pokemon matches with a person, and also having to scan each pokemon to find similarities.

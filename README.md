Team 5 of Lab A2 - **indicates the idea we have chosen

## Random Weather Pokemon
 - Web app that generates a random [Pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) based on their attributes that correspond to the [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). This project will be like a weather app, with an additional Pokemon feature, to bring it more fun, so users who love Pokemon can get Pokemons and weather data in one place. Our database in this app will hold information for user login such as name, email, password, and a "Pokedex" for all the Pokemons they have collected.
